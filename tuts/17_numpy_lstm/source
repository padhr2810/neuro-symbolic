"""
Originally developed by me (Peter Christensen), Nicklas Hansen, and Alexander Johansen as educational material for the graduate deep learning course at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
To really get a grasp of what is going on inside the recurrent neural networks that we are about to teach you, we will carry out a substantial part of this exercise in NumPy rather than PyTorch. Once you get a hold of it, we will proceed to the PyTorch implementation.

In this notebook we will show you:

    How to represent categorical variables in networks
    How to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) from scratch
    How to build a LSTM network from scratch
    How to build a LSTM network in PyTorch
