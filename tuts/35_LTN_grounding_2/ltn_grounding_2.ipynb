    "common fuzzy semantics using PyTorch primitives is included in the `ltn.fuzzy_ops` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we recommend using the following semantics for LTN connectives:\n",
    "* the standard negation  $\\lnot u = 1-u$;\n",
    "* the product t-norm $u \\land v = uv$;\n",
    "* the product t-conorm (probabilistic sum) $u \\lor v = u+v-uv$;\n",

    "\n",
    "where $u$ and $v$ denote two truth values in $[0,1]$.\n",
